##  About me

👋 Hi, I'm Selorm, a passionate software developer and computer science student based in Ghana. My journey into the world of technology has been a thrilling adventure, with a focus on frontend development, fullstack web development, and a newfound fascination with 2D animation.

🌱 I'm currently a student at Ghana Communication Technology University, where I'm dedicated to honing my coding skills and expanding my knowledge in the field. In addition to coding, I've recently taken my first steps into the enchanting realm of 2D animation. Through animation, I'm able to breathe life into my creative ideas, giving them a dynamic and expressive form.

🚀 My goal is to become a proficient fullstack developer and a skilled 2D animator. I believe in the power of coding and animation to make a positive impact in the world, and I'm committed to a path of continual learning and improvement in both of these exciting domains.

🎨 When I'm not coding or experimenting with animation, you'll often find me brainstorming ideas and taking the first steps in the world of 2D animation. I may be a newbie, but I'm eager to learn and grow in this creative field.

📫 Let's connect and learn from each other. Feel free to reach out on GitHub or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/selormdev). I'm excited to be part of the tech and animation communities, and I'm eager to collaborate with fellow developers and animators on inspiring projects.

Happy coding and animating! 🖥️🎬🎨
